# Setup #

<br>Enable billing for your project!</br>

```
gcloud init
```

# Running Locally #

**Set up virtual environment (This is only for MAC)** 
```
virtualenv -p python3 env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Create a Cloud Storage bucket. It is recommended that you name it the same as your project ID: ( I named it awesome bucketness, so whatever)**
```
gsutil mb gs://${PROJECT_ID}
```

**Set the environmental variable `CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET`:**
```
export CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET=${PROJECT_ID}
```

**Then in the virtual environment (you will see <env> to the left of your terminal), run these commands:**
```
export FLASK_ENV="development"
main python.py
```
  
Visit `localhost:8000` to view your application running locally (or `127.0.0.1:5000`). Press `Control-C` on your command line when you are finished.
```deactivate``` 
once you are ready to leave virtual environment (env)

# Deploying to App Engine #
Open `app.yampl` and replace with the name of your Cloud Storage bucket.

Deploy your application to App Enginge with gcloud. Please note this takes several minutes. 
```
gcloud app deploy
```
Visit `https://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].appspot.com` to view your deployed web application.
